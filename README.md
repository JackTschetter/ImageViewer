## About the Project

This project was created for teaching the class CSCI 4271W --- Designing and Developing Secure Software at UMN Twin Cities. I developed and taught from this project during Spring Semester 2024. 

BCIMGVIEW is the latest and greatest product from badly coded industries! It is an image viewer inspired by eye of gnome. BCIMGVIEW supports the following three bitmap image formats.
<li>BC-Raw, with the file extension .bcraw, is an uncompressed true color format similar to bcimgviewâ€™s internal representation and to PPM.</li>li>
BC-Progressive, extension .bcprog, is intended for transmitting images over low- bandwidth network connections, like web sites in the 1990s. Colors are represented with single bytes from a 6x6x6 color cube, and scanlines are sent in an interleaved order.
BC-Flat,extension.bcflat,isalosslesslycompressedtruecolorformatthatseparately encodes the red, green, and blue channels. The differences between adjacent samples in a scan line are computed and then one or more differences are encoded with a fixed dictionary of variable-length binary codewords.

## Attack I

## Attack II

## Attack III

## Attack IV --- Incorrect decompression logic in .bcflat encoded files leads to stack buffer overflow

This was by far the most subtle of all 4 attacks. Some might call it the most beautiful! Of roughly 70 students in this course, only 2 found and exploited this vulnerability perfectly. It is also notable because it was the only one of the 4 intentionally planted vulnerabilities which led to a buffer overflow on the stack. All the other buffer overflows were on the heap.

## Attack V --- CSS Injection

### Summary of the attack

This was not actually an attack in the most literal sense of the word. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is not a Turing complete language, so this vulnerability does not actually have the potential to cause things like arbitrary code execution or elevation of privilege.

In the wild however CSS injections can still be problematic. One such example could be an attacker using a CSS injection attack to display harmful advertisements on your website.

In our case the offending portion of the code is highlighted below. The vulnerability stems directly from a careless usage of environment variables on line 1954.<br><br>
